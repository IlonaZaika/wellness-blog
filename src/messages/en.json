      "subtitle": "Message from the Founder",
      "description": "In 2006, my life changed in an instant. A broken leg, four surgeries, and a long rehabilitation process left me facing a future filled with uncertainty. Doctors couldn't guarantee that I would ever walk, run, or dance again. But I refused to accept those limitations. Through dedicated training, expert guidance, and relentless perseverance, I not only regained my mobility—I discovered a passion for movement, healing, and helping others do the same.\n\nThis journey led me to study massage therapy, anatomy, and movement science. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working with people of all ages and backgrounds, guiding them toward stronger, healthier bodies. What I've learned is simple: movement is freedom. Pain and stiffness should never hold you back from living fully. That's why I created this space—to support, inspire, and empower you on your own journey to wellness. Whether through massage, posture-focused exercises, or Nordic walking, my mission is to help you feel comfortable, capable, and confident in your body. You are never too old, too injured, or too late to start. Let's move forward—together.",
